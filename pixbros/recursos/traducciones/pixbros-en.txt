Once upon a time there were three brothers who really enjoyed playing videogames. The three of them enjoyed the same games, but each had their favorite character.
Pix loved Snow Bros, where you manage a Snowman that turns enemies into a snowball and then push it away.
Pux just couldn't get enough of Bubble Bobble, where you're a dragon that throws bubbles to lock on enemies.
Pax was a fanatic of Tumple Top, where you play as a boy that vacuums monsters.
One day, they began arguing about which Heroe was the greatest. 
After a while discussing about it, they realized they were all alone in the Arcades. Just as they were leaving a door opened 
right behind them, a door they had never seen before, a door that locked a misterious rooms.
When they entered the room, they saw an special arcade machine, with no joysticks nor buttons, only 3 "Starts".
If they had known what would happen to them, they would've have never pushed those buttons.. They just pushed it and they dissapeared.
No one knows what happened to them.
