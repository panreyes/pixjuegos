Once upon a time there were three brothers who really enjoyed playing videogames. The three of them enjoyed the same games, but each one had their favorite character.
Pix loved Snow Bros, where you play as a Snowman that turns enemies into snowballs and push them away.
Pux, on the other hand, just couldn't get enough of Bubble Bobble, where you're a dragon who throws bubbles to lock in your enemies.
Pax, for his part, was a fanatic of Tumple Top, whose main character is a boy that vacuums monsters.
One day, they began arguing about which hero was the greatest. 
After discussing it for a while, they realized they were all alone in the Arcades, just as a door got open right behind them, a door they had never seen before, a door that locked a misterious room.
When they entered the room, they saw a special arcade machine, with no joysticks nor buttons, only 3 "Starts" on it.
If they had known what would happen to them, they would have never pushed those buttons... Then, they just dissapeared.
No one knows what happened to the three brothers.
