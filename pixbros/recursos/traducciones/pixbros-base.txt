------INTRO TRANSLATION:------
once upon a time there were three
brothers who really enjoyed playing videogames
the three of them enjoyed the same kind of games, 
but each had their favourite game

pix loved snow bros, where you play as a snowman
that turns enemies into a snowball and then pushes
it away

pux just couldn't get enough of bubble bobble,
where you're a dragon that throws bubbles
to lock on enemies

pax is really fan of tumble pop, where you play
as a boy that vacuums monsters

one day, they began arguing about which hero was the greatest

after a while discussing about it, they realized 
they were all alone in the arcades. just as they
were leaving, a door opened behind them

right behind them, there was a door they had never 
seen before, a door that locked a misterious room

when they entered the room, they saw a strange arcade machine,
with no joysticks nor buttons, only 3 "starts"

if they had known what would happen to them, they would've
have never pushed those buttons. they just pushed it
and they dissapeared

no one knows what happened to them
